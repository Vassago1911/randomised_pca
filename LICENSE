randomised_pca

This algorithm is released into the public domain, since
it has been described as an explicit randomised solver for
a classical mathematics problem: Decomposing a matrix according
to its singular values. [Finding structure with randomness: Probabilistic algorithms for constructing approximate matrix decompositions (2009) ](https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4061)

The specific implementation is part of the original,
but now archived "fbpca" repository accompanying that paper.
