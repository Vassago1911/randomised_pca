Principal component analysis.

    Constructs a nearly optimal rank-k approximation U diag(s) Va to A,
    centering the columns of A first when raw is False, using n_iter
    normalized power iterations, with block size l, started with a
    min(m,n) x l random matrix, when A is m x n; the reference PCA_
    below explains "nearly optimal." k must be a positive integer <=
    the smaller dimension of A, n_iter must be a nonnegative integer,
    and l must be a positive integer >= k.

    The rank-k approximation U diag(s) Va comes in the form of a
    singular value decomposition (SVD) -- the columns of U are
    orthonormal, as are the rows of Va, and the entries of s are all
    nonnegative and nonincreasing. U is m x k, Va is k x n, and
    len(s)=k, when A is m x n.

    Increasing n_iter or l improves the accuracy of the approximation
    U diag(s) Va; the reference PCA_ below describes how the accuracy
    depends on n_iter and l. Please note that even n_iter=1 guarantees
    superb accuracy, whether or not there is any gap in the singular
    values of the matrix A being approximated, at least when measuring
    accuracy as the spectral norm || A - U diag(s) Va || of the matrix
    A - U diag(s) Va (relative to the spectral norm ||A|| of A, and
    accounting for centering when raw is False).

    Notes
    -----
    To obtain repeatable results, reset the seed for the pseudorandom
    number generator.

    The user may ascertain the accuracy of the approximation
    U diag(s) Va to A by invoking diffsnorm(A, U, s, Va), when raw is
    True. The user may ascertain the accuracy of the approximation
    U diag(s) Va to C(A), where C(A) refers to A after centering its
    columns, by invoking diffsnormc(A, U, s, Va), when raw is False.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : array_like, shape (m, n)
        matrix being approximated
    k : int, optional
        rank of the approximation being constructed;
        k must be a positive integer <= the smaller dimension of A,
        and defaults to 6
    raw : bool, optional
        centers A when raw is False but does not when raw is True;
        raw must be a Boolean and defaults to False
    n_iter : int, optional
        number of normalized power iterations to conduct;
        n_iter must be a nonnegative integer, and defaults to 2
    l : int, optional
        block size of the normalized power iterations;
        l must be a positive integer >= k, and defaults to k+2

    Returns
    -------
    U : ndarray, shape (m, k)
        m x k matrix in the rank-k approximation U diag(s) Va to A or
        C(A), where A is m x n, and C(A) refers to A after centering
        its columns; the columns of U are orthonormal
    s : ndarray, shape (k,)
        vector of length k in the rank-k approximation U diag(s) Va to
        A or C(A), where A is m x n, and C(A) refers to A after
        centering its columns; the entries of s are all nonnegative and
        nonincreasing
    Va : ndarray, shape (k, n)
        k x n matrix in the rank-k approximation U diag(s) Va to A or
        C(A), where A is m x n, and C(A) refers to A after centering
        its columns; the rows of Va are orthonormal

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.random import uniform
    >>> A = uniform(low=-1.0, high=1.0, size=(100, 2))
    >>> A = A.dot(uniform(low=-1.0, high=1.0, size=(2, 100)))

    Then we can either do:
    >>> from scipy.linalg import svd
    >>> (U, s, Va) = svd(A, full_matrices=False)
    >>> A = A / s[0]

    Or, as provided by this file:
    >>> from randomised_pca pca
    >>> (U, s, Va) = pca(A, 2, True)

    This example produces a rank-2 approximation U diag(s) Va to A such
    that the columns of U are orthonormal, as are the rows of Va, and
    the entries of s are all nonnegative and are nonincreasing.
